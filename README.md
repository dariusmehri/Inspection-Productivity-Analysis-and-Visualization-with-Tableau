For this project, I am automating the Department of Building's monthy inspection productivity report with python and Tableau. 

The objective of this project is to speed up the delivery time for the analyis, from a few days to a few hours.

Here are the steps implemented:

1. Download data from Oracle subject area databases.

2. Write a program to wrangle, clean and merge the data using the Pandas python package.

3. Establish a direct connection between Tableau and the Oracle database so that the data can be updated automatically.

3. Create dashboards and visualizations in Tableau.


Here are some visualizations created with Tableau that are used in the report:
